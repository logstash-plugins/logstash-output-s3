## 4.0.2

## 4.0.1
  - Improved Error logging for S3 validation. Now specific S3 perms errors are logged

## 4.0.0
  - This version is a complete rewrite over version 3.0.0 See #103
  - This Plugin now uses the V2 version of the SDK, this make sure we receive the latest updates and changes.
  - We now uses S3's `upload_file` instead of reading chunks, this method is more efficient and will uses the multipart with threads if the files is too big.
  - You can now use the `fieldref` syntax in the prefix to dynamically changes the target with the events it receives.
  - The Upload queue is now a bounded list, this options is necessary to allow back pressure to be communicated back to the pipeline but its configurable by the user.
  - If the queue is full the plugin will start the upload in the current thread.
  - The plugin now threadsafe and support the concurrency model `shared`
  - The rotation strategy can be selected, the recommended is `size_and_time` that will check for both the configured limits (`size` and `time` are also available)
  - The `restore` option will now use a separate threadpool with an unbounded queue
  - The `restore` option will not block the launch of logstash and will uses less resources than the real time path
  - The plugin now uses `multi_receive_encode`, this will optimize the writes to the files
  - rotate operation are now batched to reduce the number of IO calls.
  - Empty file will not be uploaded by any rotation rotation strategy
  - We now use Concurrent-Ruby for the implementation of the java executor
  - If you have finer grain permission on prefixes or want faster boot, you can disable the credentials check with `validate_credentials_on_root_bucket`
  - The credentials check will no longer fails if we can't delete the file
  - We now have a full suite of integration test for all the defined rotation

Fixes: #4 #81 #44 #59 #50

  - improve exception handling

## 3.0.1
